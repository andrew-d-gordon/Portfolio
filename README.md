Thank you for stopping by my portfolio!

A project in development at this moment is Delish! It makes use of GCP, Google Maps API, Google Firebase, Node.js and Google's NoSQL, Firestore Database to provide a unique cuisine searching experience. Information on the project can be found here: [Delish Web App](https://github.com/cyruskarsan/Delish-Food). I personally built out the frontend functionality, integrated Google Firebase functions on the backend, and am developing the addition of Google Sign In's to retain rating and favorite restaurant information for users.

A sponsored project by Cisco to develop a Mesh Network Generator for services is a project I was a developer for during the Winter and Spring of 2021. I worked on the encryption of communication between services utilizing WireGuard and the dynamic routing of information utilizing BGP (GoBGP Daemon). As there is no available public repo, more information on this project can be found [here](https://csspp.soe.ucsc.edu/2021cisco).

I am also currently developing a DSP and audio analysis library called poly_ns_tuner. This library provides polyphonic pitch detection tools in Python which can analyze .wav files for pitch and scale information. It can also utilize this information to generate MIDI files for the corresponding input audio.

My other notable projects at this time are a Threaded HTTP Server and Load Balancer (programmed in C), a unique set of lines finding library for sets of 2D points in Python, an Image Webscraper and Icon Generator in Python, as well as several Python Machine Learning projects for Image and Sentiment classification utilizing CNN's, RNN's and Regression (TensorFlow).
