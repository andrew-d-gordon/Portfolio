Thank you for stopping by my portfolio!
My most recent project is a full stack web-app called DELISH. It makes use of MongoDB, Google Maps API, and Google Cloud Platform to provide a unique cuisine searching experience. 
Information on the project can be found here: [Delish Web App](https://github.com/andrew-d-gordon/Delish-Food)
The project was developed by myself and four colleagues while practicing AGILE development.

My other notable projects at this time are a multi-threaded HTTP Server and multi-threaded Load Balancer (programmed in C).
Additionally I have machine learning and python experience via projects using regression techniques as well as tensorflow and keras for neural network modeling.
