Thank you for stopping by my portfolio!
My most recent project is a full stack web-app called Delish. It makes use of MongoDB, Google Maps API, Firebase, and Google Cloud Platform to provide a unique cuisine searching experience. 
Information on the project can be found here: [Delish Web App](https://github.com/andrew-d-gordon/Delish-Food), or in the Delish-Food-main folder above.
The service was developed by myself and four colleagues at UCSC.

Another recent project is my DSP/audio programming project called poly_ns_tuner. This project serves as a polyphonic pitch detection library for python to analyze .wav files for pitch and scale information. It can also as generate MIDI files based on the pitch detection output.

My other notable projects at this time are a multi-threaded HTTP Server and multi-threaded Load Balancer (programmed in C), an Image Webscraper and Icon Generator in Python, as well as several Python Machine Learning projects for Image and Sentiment classification utilizing CNN's, RNN's and Regression (TensorFlow).
